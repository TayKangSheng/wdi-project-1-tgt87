# Treasure Hunt
A strategy game where the player builds his own path and collects items (sword, shield & key) along the way in order to defeat a monster and obtain the treasure.

## Getting Started
It is best to use Chrome and you can play the game [here](https://wdi-sg.github.io/wdi-project-1-tgt87/).

### How to play
* Clicking on the 'Place tiles' button will enable you to place 2 tiles on the board.
* You'll need to click the button each time you wish to place tiles on the board.
* Each click on the button (except the first click) will cost you 1 turn.
* To place the tiles on the board, click on the grid that you wish to place your tiles on.
* Move your character using the arrow keys. You are only allowed to move along the path that you have built.
* Collect items (sword, shield & key) along the way.
* To defeat the monster, you need to have both sword and shield in your inventory.
* To get the treasure, you need to have key in your inventory and the monster defeated.
* You win the game if you are able to get the treasure before your turns runs out.
* You lose the game if you move to the grid containing the monster without having both sword and shield in your inventory or when your turns runs out.
